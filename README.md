## Project site

1. Add project entry to `project.md`
2. Create a folder for the project under `projects` directory, say `icra19`.
3. Create the index page by editing `index.md` in the folder just created, say, `icra19/index.md` in this example.
4. 
## Workflow

- To preview the website locally, need to install jekyll using gem (may need to upgrade ruby to version 2.2 or higher first): `sudo gem install jekyll`

- Serve the website at port 4000 of localhost: `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` of bundler (sandbox?) is used.
