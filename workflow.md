To preview the website locally, need to install jekyll using gem (may need to upgrade ruby to version 2.2 or higher first)

sudo gem install jekyll

Make changes and build:

jekyll build

Deploy the website at port 4000 of localhost:

jekyll serve

Go to 

http://localhost:4000

and check the website.
